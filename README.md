# Gambling-Game
Computer program ( gambling.py ) that simulates a game between two players.The program must ask for each player to enter his name. Each player rolls a fair six-sided dice one after another. The process is repeated until a player gets a 6. The winner is the first player to get a 6. The program then returns the name of the winner and the number of trials before the success. 

# Dice-simulation
a program diceSimulation1.py to simulate the following experiment:
(a) Spin a dice n = 100 times and count the number of times face number 6 has shown up.
Repeat the process N times (say N = 1000 ).
(b) Plot the histogram of the distribution of the number of times face number 6 has shown up
using the pylab function hist.
(c) Plot the histogram of the distribution of the number of times face number 6 has shown up
using asterisks. Your histogram must be similar to the following where the number of asterisks
indicates the frequency of the number directly to the left
